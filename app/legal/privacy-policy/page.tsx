                <h2>II. Client relationship and contractual relationship with business partners</h2>

                <h3>1. DESCRIPTION AND SCOPE OF DATA PROCESSING</h3>

                <p>We primarily process personal data that we receive directly from our clients within the scope of our client
                    relationships. It is also possible that we receive or collect data from business partners or other persons
                    involved. Insofar as this is permitted and necessary, we also obtain data from publicly accessible sources (e.g.
                    public registers, media, Internet) or receive such data from our clients and their employees, from authorities,
                    (arbitration) courts and other third parties (e.g. counterparties, business partners and contractual partners of
                    our clients).</p>

                <p>In addition to the data that we receive directly from you, the categories of personal data that we receive from
                    third parties include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Master data (e.g. names, addresses, functions, organizational affiliation, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Contact data (email address, phone number, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Content data (e.g. text and image files, videos, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Usage data (e.g. access data)</li>
                    <li>Meta/communication data (e.g. IP addresses)</li>
                    <li>Information from public registers (debt collection registers, commercial registers, land registers)</li>
                    <li>Information on compliance with legal requirements (e.g. combating money laundering and export restrictions)</li>
                    <li>Information related to your professional functions and activities</li>
                    <li>Information about you in correspondence and discussions with third parties</li>
                    <li>Creditworthiness information (if we conduct business with you personally)</li>
                    <li>Information from banks, insurance companies, distributors and other contractual partners from us on the use or provision of services by you (e.g. payments made/purchases made)</li>
                    <li>Information from media and Internet about you (as far as this is indicated in the concrete case), as well as</li>
                    <li>References for applications.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. PURPOSES OF DATA PROCESSING AND LEGAL BASIS</h3>

                <p>We process the personal data collected in order to guarantee the performance of the relationship or for contract
                    processing, invoicing and communication purposes. Furthermore, we process personal data, as far as permitted and
                    necessary, also for the following purposes, in particular but not limited to those in which we (and also third
                    parties) have a legitimate interest corresponding to the purpose:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Measures for IT, building and plant security and protection of our employees and other persons and assets
                        entrusted to us (e.g. access controls, visitor lists, network and mail scanners, telephone records);</li>
                    <li>Any transactions under company law and the associated transfer of personal data as well as measures for
                        business management and compliance with legal and regulatory obligations.</li>
                    <li>Offer and further development of our offers and services</li>
                    <li>Advertising and marketing (including the organisation of events), provided that you have not objected to the
                        use of your data;</li>
                    <li>Market and opinion research, media monitoring.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If you have given your consent to the processing of your personal data for certain purposes (e.g. to carry out a
                    background check), we will process your personal data within the scope of and based on this consent, insofar as we
                    have no other legal basis and we require such a basis. Any given consent can be revoked for the future at any
                    time.</p>

                <h4>3. DURATION OF STORAGE</h4>

                <p>The personal data collected by us will only be stored for as long as it is necessary for the execution of the relationship (from the initiation to the termination of a contract) or the other purposes pursued with the processing and/or a legal obligation to store and document or a predominant private or public interest exists. As soon as the personal data collected by us are no longer required for the above-mentioned purposes, it will be deleted or anonymised.</p>

                <br />

                <h2>III. Use of our website</h2>

                <br />

                <h3>A. PROVISION OF THE WEBSITE AND CREATION OF LOG FILES</h3>

                <br />

                <h4>1. DESCRIPTION AND SCOPE OF DATA PROCESSING</h4>

                <p>Each time you access our website, our system automatically collects data and information from the computer system of the accessing computer. The following data is collected:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Information about the browser type and the version used</li>
                    <li>The user's operating system</li>
                    <li>The IP address of the user</li>
                    <li>Date and time of access</li>
                    <li>Websites from which the user's system accesses our website</li>
                    <li>Page viewed on the website</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The IP addresses are stored in the log files of our system. This does not apply to the other data which enable the assignment of the data to a user. These data are not stored together with other personal data of the user.</p>

                <br />

                <h4>2. PURPOSES OF DATA PROCESSING AND LEGAL BASIS</h4>

                <p>The temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary to enable delivery of the website to the user's computer. For this purpose, the IP address must remain stored for the duration of the session.</p>

                <p>The data is stored in log files to ensure the functionality of the website. The data is also used to optimise the website and to ensure the security of our information technology systems. An evaluation of the data for marketing purposes does not take place in this context.</p>

                <p>Our legitimate interest in data processing also lies in these purposes.</p>

                <br />

                <h4>3. DURATION OF STORAGE</h4>

                <p>The data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which they were collected. In the case of the collection of data for the purpose of providing the website, this is the case when the respective session in question has ended.</p>

                <p>In the case of storage of data in log files, this is the case after seven days at the latest. Storage beyond this period is possible. In this case the IP addresses of the users are deleted or alienated so that an assignment of the calling client is no longer possible.</p>

                <br />

                <h3>B. USE OF COOKIES</h3>

                <br />

                <h4>1. DESCRIPTION AND SCOPE OF DATA PROCESSING</h4>

                <p>Our website uses cookies. Cookies are small text files that are automatically stored on the hard disk of your computer when you visit our website. The cookies do not pose any danger to the computer.</p>

                <p>Technically necessary cookies increase the functionality of the website. Cookies that are not technically necessary increase the user-friendliness of the website.</p>

                <p>Our cookies can be either session cookies (temporary cookies that identify you as a user and track your progress within our websites as long as your browser is open) or persistent cookies (cookies that allow our websites to "remember" who you are and what your preferences are within our websites and that remain on your computer or device even after you close your browser).</p>

                <p>The user data collected in this way is pseudonymised by technical precautions. It is therefore no longer possible to assign the data to the calling user. The data are not stored together with other personal data of the users.</p>

                <br />

                <h4>2. PURPOSE OF DATA PROCESSING AND LEGAL BASIS</h4>

                <p>The purpose of using technically necessary cookies is to simplify the use of websites for users. Some functions of our website cannot be offered without the use of cookies. For these, it is necessary that the browser is recognized also after a page change.</p>

                <p>We need cookies for the following applications:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Adoption of language settings</li>
                    <li>Transfer of filter settings (team, magazine articles, publications)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The user data collected by technically necessary cookies are not used to create user profiles.</p>

                <p>Cookies that are not technically necessary are used for the purpose of improving the quality of our website and its contents. These cookies tell us how the website is used and enable us to continually optimize our services.</p>

                <p>Our legitimate interest in the processing of personal data also lies in the aforementioned purposes.</p>

                <br />

                <h4>3. DURATION OF STORAGE, POSSIBILITY OF OBJECTION AND WITHDRAWAL</h4>

                <p>The session cookies are deleted after a short time, but at the latest when you close your browser. With persistent cookies, the website remembers your preferences and settings so that they are available the next time you visit the website. Permanent cookies are deleted after a certain period of time.</p>

                <p>As a user, you have full control over the use of cookies. You can prevent the use of cookies by clicking on the "refuse" button in the cookie banner. Furthermore, you can deactivate or restrict the transmission of cookies by changing the settings in your Internet browser. Cookies that have already been saved can be deleted at any time. This can also be done automatically. If cookies are deactivated for our website, it is possible that all functions of the website can no longer be used to their full extent.</p>

                <br />

                <h3>C. NEWSLETTER</h3>

                <br />

                <h4>1. DESCRIPTION AND SCOPE OF DATA PROCESSING</h4>

                <p>You can subscribe to newsletters on our website. We send our existing and potential clients information on blockchain, crypto and compliance issues at irregular intervals.</p>

                <p>Your consent to the processing of the data will be obtained before or during registration and reference will be made to this data protection declaration. The data will be used exclusively for the dispatch of the newsletter.</p>

                <br />

                <h4>2. PURPOSE OF DATA PROCESSING AND LEGAL BASIS</h4>

                <p>The collection of your e-mail address serves to deliver the newsletter. The collection of other personal data as part of the registration process serves to prevent misuse of the services or the e-mail address used.</p>

                <p>We process your personal data collected during registration for the newsletter based on your consent.</p>

                <br />

                <h4>3. DURATION OF STORAGE</h4>

                <p>The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose of its collection. The user's e-mail address will therefore be stored as long as the newsletter subscription is active. If a client/business relationship exists between you and us pursuant to Section II, the provisions set out in Section II.4 shall apply.</p>

                <p>The other personal data collected during the registration process will generally be deleted after a period of seven days.</p>

                <br />

                <h4>4. POSSIBILITY OF OPPOSITION AND WITHDRAWAL</h4>

                <p>The subscription of the newsletter can be cancelled by the affected user at any time. For this purpose, there is a corresponding link in every newsletter. This also enables the withdrawal of the consent to the storage of personal data collected during the registration process.</p>

                <br />

                <h3>D. CONTACT FORM AND E-MAIL CONTACT</h3>

                <br />

                <h4>1. DESCRIPTION AND SCOPE OF DATA PROCESSING</h4>

                <p>A contact form is available on our website, which can be used for electronic contact. If a user makes use of this possibility, the data entered in the input mask will be transmitted to us and stored. These data are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>First name and surname</li>
                    <li>Company (voluntary)</li>
                    <li>E-mail address (optional)</li>
                    <li>Background and information about your request (voluntary)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The following data will also be stored at the time the message is sent:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>IP address</li>
                    <li>Date and time of the sending process</li>
                    <li>Page on which the form was filled out</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Before sending the contact form we will refer to this privacy policy.</p>

                <p>Alternatively, it is possible to contact us via the e-mail address provided. In this case the personal data transmitted by you by e-mail will be stored.</p>

                <br />

                <h4>2. PURPOSES OF DATA PROCESSING AND LEGAL BASES</h4>

                <p>The processing of the personal data from the input mask or from the e-mail you have sent to us serves us solely to process the establishment of contact. The other personal data processed during the sending process serve to prevent misuse of the contact form and to ensure the security of our information technology systems. This is also our legitimate interest in the processing of the data.</p>

                <p>If the purpose of establishing contact is to conclude a contract, data processing is also necessary for the purpose of implementing pre-contractual measures as well as for the fulfilment and execution of the contract.</p>

                <br />

                <h4>3. DURATION OF STORAGE</h4>

                <p>In order to ensure compliance with our contractual and legal obligations (in particular with regard to storage and documentation obligations as an accredited lawyer), we require access to all user communications. Consequently, the personal data from the contact form or the personal data sent by e-mail will be deleted at the earliest after 10 years.</p>

                <p>The additional personal data collected during the sending process will be deleted at the latest after a period of seven days.</p>

                <br />

                <h4>4. POSSIBILITY OF OBJECTION AND WITHDRAWAL</h4>

                <p>If data in the contact form is not clearly marked as voluntary and the processing is not carried out on the basis of a consent, we cannot provide our intended service if the consent for data processing is refused.</p>

                <br />

                <h3>E. DATA TRANSFER TO THIRD PARTIES AND TRANSBORDER DATA FLOWS</h3>

                <br />

                <h4>1. IT PROVIDER</h4>

                <p>We work with third parties who provide services to us and may share your personal information with them, for example with IT providers who may have limited access to your personal information in software or system support.</p>

                <br />

                <h4>2. USE OF MARKETING SERVICES</h4>

                <p>We may use Marketing Services from a variety of marketing service providers, on our website for our online marketing activities.</p>

                <p>So-called web beacons are used and cookies are also set, which are stored on your computer and enable us to analyse your use of the website. The Marketing Service Providers evaluate the information collected (e.g. IP address, geographical location, type of browser, duration of visit and pages viewed) on our behalf in order to generate reports on the visit and pages viewed.</p>

                <p>If newsletters are subscribed to as described in Section C and other documents are obtained, the Service Provider can also link a user's visits to our website to personal data (above all name/email address) on the basis of a consent given, thus recording personal data and informing users individually and purposefully about preferred subject areas.</p>

                <p>We use all information collected exclusively to optimise our branding. This is also our legitimate interest in data processing.</p>

                <p>If a collection by a Marketing Service Provider is generally not desired, the storage of cookies can be prevented at any time by appropriate browser settings (see above under point B.3).</p>

                <br />

                <h4>3. WEB ANALYSIS BY GOOGLE ANALYTICS</h4>

                <br />

                <h5>3.1 SCOPE OF THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA</h5>

                <p>On our website we use Google Analytics. Google Ireland (based in Ireland) is our provider of “Google Analytics” and acts as our processor. Google Ireland relies on Google LLC (based in the US) as a processor for its services (both “Google”). Google uses performance cookies (see above) to track the behavior of visitors to our website (duration, frequency of pages viewed, geographic origin of access, etc.) and compiles reports for us on the use of our website on this basis. We have configured the service so that the IP addresses of visitors are shortened by Google in Europe before being forwarded to the US and thus cannot be traced. We have turned off the "Data Forwarding" and "Signals" settings. Although we can assume that the information we share with Google is not personal data for Google, it is possible that Google can draw conclusions about the identity of visitors from this data for its own purposes, create personal profiles and link this data to the Google accounts of these persons. If you consent to the use of Google Analytics, you explicitly agree to such processing, which also includes the transfer of personal data (in particular usage data for the website and app, device information and individual IDs) to the US and other countries not offering adequate data protection from a Swiss/EU perspective. Information on the data protection of Google Analytics can be found <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html">here</a> and if you have a Google account, you can find further details on processing by Google <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/de/analytics/learn/privacy.html">here</a>.</p>

                <br />

                <h5>3.2 PURPOSES OF DATA PROCESSING AND LEGAL BASIS</h5>

                <p>The processing of the data enables us to analyse the surfing behaviour of our users. By evaluating the data obtained, we are able to compile information about the use of the individual components of our website. This helps us to constantly improve our website and its user-friendliness. In these purposes, our legitimate interest lies in the processing of the data. By anonymizing the IP address, the interest of users in the protection of their personal data is sufficiently taken into account.</p>

                <br />

                <h5>3.3 DURATION OF THE STORAGE AS WELL AS OBJECTION AND WITHDRAWAL POSSIBILITY</h5>

                <p>The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required for our recording purposes. As a user, you have full control over the use of cookies. You can deactivate or restrict the transmission of cookies by changing the settings in your Internet browser. Cookies that have already been saved can be deleted at any time. This can also be done automatically. If cookies are deactivated for our website, it is possible that all functions of the website can no longer be used to their full extent.</p>

                <h4>4. DATA PROTECTION FOR PROTECTION FOR APPLICATIONS</h4>

                <p>The data controller shall collect and process the personal data of applicants for the purpose of the processing of the applications. The processing may also be carried out electronically. This is the case, in particular, if an applicant submits corresponding application documents by e-mail or by means of a web form on the website to the controller.</p>

                <br />

                <h4>5. DATA PROTECTION PROVISIONS ABOUT THE APPLICATION AND USE BY FACEBOOK</h4>

                <p>On this website, the controller has integrated components of the enterprise Facebook. Facebook is a social network.</p>

                <p>A social network is a place for social meetings on the Internet, an online community, which usually allows users to communicate with each other and interact in a virtual space. A social network may serve as a platform for the exchange of opinions and experiences, or enable the Internet community to provide personal or business-related information. Facebook allows social network users to include the creation of private profiles, upload photos, and network through friend requests.</p>

                <p>With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet website, which is operated by the controller and into which a Facebook component (Facebook plug-ins) was integrated, the web browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to download display of the corresponding Facebook component from Facebook through the Facebook component. An overview of all the Facebook Plug-ins may be accessed under <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/</a>. During the course of this technical procedure, Facebook is made aware of what specific sub-site of our website was visited by the data subject.</p>

                <p>If the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook, Facebook detects with every call-up to our website by the data subject—and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site—which specific sub-site of our Internet page was visited by the data subject. This information is collected through the Facebook component and associated with the respective Facebook account of the data subject. If the data subject clicks on one of the Facebook buttons integrated into our website, e.g. the “Like” button, or if the data subject submits a comment, then Facebook matches this information with the personal Facebook user account of the data subject and stores the personal data.</p>

                <p>Facebook always receives, through the Facebook component, information about a visit to our website by the data subject, whenever the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook during the time of the call-up to our website. This occurs regardless of whether the data subject clicks on the Facebook component or not. If such a transmission of information to Facebook is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she may prevent this by logging off from their Facebook account before a call-up to our website is made.</p>

                <p>The data protection guideline published by Facebook, which is available at <a href="https://facebook.com/about/privacy/">https://facebook.com/about/privacy/</a>, provides information about the collection, processing and use of personal data by Facebook. In addition, it is explained there what setting options Facebook offers to protect the privacy of the data subject. In addition, different configuration options are made available to allow the elimination of data transmission to Facebook. These applications may be used by the data subject to eliminate a data transmission to Facebook.</p>
